PLEASE NOTE: This is a Chrome extension meaning it only works on the web version of Discord ON CHROME. This may not
work in the Discord app or on the web version from different browsers.

Until I upload this to the Chrome Webstore you must unpack it manually to use it.

Steps to manually unpack:
  1) Download manifest.json, content.js, and styles.css and put them in a folder
  2) go to chrome://extensions/
  3) Enable developer mode at the top right
  4) Click load unpacked at the top left
  5) Select the folder with these files
  6) Make sure to turn it on

How to use the extension 

  Right click a user who you want to add a timezone for.
  You can right click their username from the DM list or from one of their
  chats in a DM. Note it may not work if the message is sent from a group chat.

  Click the Add Timezone button at the top of the drop down menu.

  To view their set timezone just right click their username again their local time 
  will be formatted at the top of the drop down menu.
